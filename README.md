TileMill-GMapsStyle
===================

A TileMill styleset for rendering maps similar to GMaps

Download the TileMill project and open.
The shapefiles are not included, so you will need to correct the paths to your local shapefiles.
The styles in the project are configured to work with any IMPOSM shapefiles. They can be downloaded from http://metro.teczno.com/
Once the shapefiles are placed into layers, TileMill should render them according to the style.
